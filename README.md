# qix
Odin remake of the [Qix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix) arcade game.

# Installing and Running Qix
Raylib is used to drive this project, meaning it is cross platform! Just head over to the releases page and download your platform's build artifacts.

## Building from source
Download [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) or build from [source](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin). Due to Odin's design philosophy and ease of using vendored libraries like Raylib, running Qix is as simple as `odin run .`.  

## Motivation
This project is largely motivated by my Dad, who loves this game and introduced it to me recently. It aims to be a faithful cross platform replica of the 80s arcade game.
